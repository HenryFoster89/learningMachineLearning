# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains various projects aimed at learning and maintaining Python code for developing machine learning algorithms.

## Repository Structure

### Completed Projects
- **knn_iris_project**
  - First project, implemented with the help of ChatGPT.

- **knn_wine**
  - Second project, focused on developing a functional algorithm based on insights gained from `knn_iris_project`.

### In Progress / Dataset Links
- **knn_penguin**
  - Empty repository containing a dataset link for future implementation.

- **knn_breast**
  - Empty repository containing a dataset link for future implementation.

## Goals
- Learn and apply machine learning concepts.
- Develop and refine Python implementations.
- Build working algorithms based on iterative learning and experimentation.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance these projects!
